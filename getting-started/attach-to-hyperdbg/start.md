In contrast with the kernel debugger, the user debugger is still very basic and needs a lot of tests and improvements. We **highly recommend** not to run the user debugger in your bare metal system. Instead, run it on a supported virtual machine to won't end up with a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) in your primary device. Please keep reporting the issues to improve the user debugger.
