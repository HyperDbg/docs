# Supported Virtual Machines

Current versions of **HyperDbg** are tested and confirmed it's working on the following vendors with support to the bate metal/nested virtualization:

* HyperDbg works on [regular computers](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/getting-started/attach-to-hyperdbg/local-debugging) with support to the Intel VT-x. It was tested on 4th Intel processors and later generations.
* [VMware Workstation](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/tips-and-tricks/nested-virtualization-environments/run-hyperdbg-on-vmware) (**v16.0.0** or above, older version might work as well!).

We're working on adding the support for Hyper-V's nested virtualization, but it's not supported yet.

You can use both VMware Workstation pro as well as VMware Workstation Player (Free for non-commercial use).
