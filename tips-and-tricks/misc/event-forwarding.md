# Event Forwarding

Event forwarding is a feature that sends the results of executing events to files, named pipes, and TCP sockets so **HyperDbg** can be used as an event gathering and analyzing platform.

{% hint style="success" %}
You can use [**event forwarding**](https://docs.hyperdbg.com/tips-and-tricks/misc/event-forwarding) if you want to forward the event monitoring result from this event and other events to an external source e.g. **File**, **NamedPipe**, or **TCP Socket**. This way you can use **HyperDbg** as a monitoring tool and gather the behavior of your target system.
