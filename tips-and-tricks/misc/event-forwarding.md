# Event Forwarding

Event forwarding is a feature that sends the results of executing events to files, named pipes, and TCP sockets so **HyperDbg** can be used as an event gathering and analyzing platform.

You can use [**event forwarding**](https://docs.hyperdbg.com/tips-and-tricks/misc/event-forwarding) if you want to forward the event monitoring result from this event and other events to an external source.

Event \(output\)

* File
* NamedPipe
