# How to create a condition?

HyperDbg supports to create conditional events, each event has one [condition ](https://docs.hyperdbg.com/design/debugger-internals/conditions)and can have multiple [actions](https://docs.hyperdbg.com/design/debugger-internals/actions).

An unconditional event is an event that all its actions will be executed without any condition.

This document is a brief of how to create a conditional event.

Each command in HyperDbg that we call it an "event", follows a same structure described [here](https://docs.hyperdbg.com/design/debugger-internals/events).
