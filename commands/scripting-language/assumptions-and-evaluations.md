# Assumptions & Evaluations

The following articles describe **HyperDbg**'s _Script Engine_.

The evaluation engine is open-source and it is available at the [evaluation](https://github.com/HyperDbg/evaluation) repository.

### Description

**HyperDbg** uses a MASM-like \(Windbg\) syntax to evaluate script expressions.

{% hint style="success" %}
**HyperDbg** script engine is case-insensitive.
{% endhint %}

### Keywords

The following keywords are valid in **Script Engine**.

| Keyword | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **poi** | Pointer-sized data from the specified address. |
| **hi** | High 16 bits |
| **low** | Low 16 bits |
| **db** | Low 8 bits |
| **dd** | Low 16 bits |
| **dw** | Low 32 bits |
| **dq** | 64 bits |
| **str** | Read the address as an ANSII string |
| **wstr** | Read the address as a wide-char string |
| **sizeof** | Size of the target variable |
| **not** | Flip each and every bit |
| **neg** | True/False logic flipping |

### Operators

The following operators are supported on the script engine.

| Operator | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| \( \) | Parentheses |
| \* / % | Arithmetic Operators |
| + - | Arithmetic Operators |
| &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; | Shift Operators |
| & | Bitwise AND Operator |
| ^ | Bitwise XOR Operator \(exclusive OR\) |
| \| | Bitwise OR Operator |

### Pseudo-registers

Here are the currently supported pseudo-registers supported by the script engine.

| Pseudo-register | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **$pid** | The process ID \(PID\) of the current process. |
| **$proc** | The address of the current process \(that is, the address of the`EPROCESS` block\). |
| **$tid** | The thread ID for the current thread. |
| **$thread** | The address of the current thread. In kernel-mode debugging, this address is the address of the `ETHREAD` block. |
| **$peb** | The address of the process environment block \(PEB\) of the current process. |
| **$teb** | The address of the thread environment block \(TEB\) of the current thread. |
| **$ip** | The instruction pointer register \(rip\). |
| **$buffer** | The pre-allocated buffer if the user requests a safe buffer. |

### Number Prefixes

By default, **HyperDbg** interprets the numbers as hex \(base 16\), if you want to specify other forms of a number you should use MASM prefixes. In all MASM expressions, numeric values are interpreted as numbers in the current radix \(16, 10, or 8\). You can override the default radix by specifying the 0x prefix \(hexadecimal\), the 0n prefix \(decimal\), the 0t prefix \(octal\), or the 0y prefix \(binary\).

### Functions

The following functions are supported in **Script Engine**.
