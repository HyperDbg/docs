# count occurrences of an event

One of the use cases of HyperDbg is counting the occurrence of different events. However, incrementing and decrementing value from different cores are problematic as you can't add everything by using mathematical operators as the result might not be accurate.

The problem arises from the fact that if you want to access a value to add or subtract the value, other cores might do the same operation simaltaneously and each of the cores are computing the new values at the same time so we might (and will) lose some of the operations as the current core's computation might be replaced by other core's results.

In order to prevent this problem, you can use interlocked functions in HyperDbg's script engine.

Imagine we want to count the number of times that system process (process id = 4) will access a paged-out page and leads to a page-fault.

For this purpose, first, we define a global variable.c

```
? .my_counter = 0;
```

After that, we'll use !exception command with 0xe parameter that shows we want to intercept page-fault and pid 4 which shows that onlÿ∫  we use interlocked_increment

```
!exception 0xe pid 4 script {
	
	.Result = interlocked_increment(&.my_counter);
}
```
