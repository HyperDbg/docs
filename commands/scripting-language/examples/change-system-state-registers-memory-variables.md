# change system state (registers, memory, variables)

Changing the system state is a crucial task for the debuggers. You can change the system's state by using different commands in the debugger. It's also possible to change the system state by using script engine.

In this example, we'll describe about general examples that can be used to modify different registers, memory, and variables.

### Changing registers

HyperDbg support more than 100 registers and flags, you can see a complete list of these registers [here](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/commands/scripting-language/assumptions-and-evaluations). Changing registers is as easy as assigning new values to them.

For example,

```
// Some code
```
