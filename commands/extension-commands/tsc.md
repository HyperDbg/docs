# !tsc \(hook RDTSC/RDTSCP instruction execution\)

### Command

> !tsc

### Syntax

> !tsc \[pid \(hex value\)\] \[core \(hex value\)\] \[event options\]

### Description

Triggers when the debugging machine executes **RDTSC** or **RDTSCP** instructions in any level of execution \(kernel-mode or user-mode\).

{% hint style="danger" %}
Using this command is not allowed in **transparent-mode**, you should not use this command in [transparent-mode](https://docs.hyperdbg.com/tips-and-tricks/considerations/transparent-mode) as it won't trigger any event.
{% endhint %}

### Parameters

**\[pid \(hex value\)\]**

          Optional value to trigger the event in just a specific process. Add `pid xx` to your command thus command will be executed if the process id is equal to `xx`. If you don't specify this option then by default you receive events on all processes.

**\[core \(hex value\)\]**

          Optional value to trigger the event in just a specific core. Add `core xx` to your command thus command will be executed if core id is equal to `xx`. If you don't specify this option then by default you receive events on all cores.

**\[event options\]**

          Regular event parameters used in HyperDbg events. \(For more information read [this ](https://docs.hyperdbg.com/using-hyperdbg/prerequisites)topic\)

### Context

As the **Context** \(**`r8`** in custom code and **`rdx`** in condition code register\) to the event trigger, **HyperDbg** sends **FALSE \(0\)** in the case of **RDTSC** and **TRUE \(1\)** in the case of **RDTSCP**.

### Debugger

This event supports three debugging mechanisms.

* Break
* Script
* Custom Code

{% hint style="info" %}
Please read  "[How to create a condition?](https://docs.hyperdbg.com/using-hyperdbg/prerequisites/how-to-create-a-condition)" if you need a conditional event, a conditional event can be used in all "**Break**", "**Script**" and "**Custom Code**".
{% endhint %}

### Break

We want to break and get control over all **RDTSC/RDTSCP** execution in our system.

```c
!tsc
```

Imagine we want to break on all **RDTSC/RDTSCP** executions of a process id **0x490**.

```c
!tsc pid 490 
```

### Script

Using the following command you can use HyperDbg's Script Engine. You should replace the string between braces \(`HyperDbg Script Here`\) with your script. You can find script examples [here](https://docs.hyperdbg.com/commands/scripting-language/examples). 

```
!tsc script { HyperDbg Script Here }
```

**Script \(From File\)**

If you saved your script into a file then you can add `file:` instead of a script and append the file path to it. For example, the following examples show how you can run a script from `file:c:\users\sina\desktop\script.txt`. 

```
!tsc script {file:c:\users\sina\desktop\script.txt}
```

### Custom Code

Please read  "[How to create an action?](https://docs.hyperdbg.com/using-hyperdbg/prerequisites/how-to-create-an-action)" for getting idea about how to run custom buffer code in **HyperDbg**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Your custom code will be executed in vmx-root mode. Take a look at [this topic](https://docs.hyperdbg.com/tips-and-tricks/considerations/vmx-root-mode-vs-vmx-non-root-mode) for more information. Running code in vmx-root is considered "[unsafe](https://docs.hyperdbg.com/tips-and-tricks/considerations/the-unsafe-behavior)".
{% endhint %}

#### Run Custom Code \(Unconditional\)

Monitoring process id **0x490** for **RDTSC/RDTSCP** instruction execution ****and run 3 nops whenever the event is triggered. Take a look at [Run Custom Code](https://docs.hyperdbg.com/using-hyperdbg/prerequisites/how-to-create-an-action#run-custom-codes), for more information.

```c
!tsc pid 490 code {90 90 90}
```

#### Run Custom Code \(Conditional\)

Monitoring process id **0x490** for **RDTSC/RDTSCP** instruction execution and run 3 nops whenever the event condition is triggered and run 3 nops whenever the event is triggered. Take a look at [Run Custom Code](https://docs.hyperdbg.com/using-hyperdbg/prerequisites/how-to-create-an-action#run-custom-codes) and [how to create a condition](https://docs.hyperdbg.com/using-hyperdbg/prerequisites/how-to-create-a-condition), for more information.

```c
!tsc pid 490 code {90 90 90} condition {90 90 90}
```

{% hint style="success" %}
Keep in mind, a conditional event can be used in **Breaking to Debugger** and **Running Script** too.
{% endhint %}

### IOCTL

This command uses the same method to [send IOCTL for regular events](https://docs.hyperdbg.com/design/debugger-internals/ioctl-requests-for-events). 

As **EventType** use `TSC_INSTRUCTION_EXECUTION` in **DEBUGGER\_GENERAL\_EVENT\_DETAIL**.

### Design

This command uses **RDTSC** \(**EXIT\_REASON\_RDTSC - 16**\) and **RDTSCP** \(**EXIT\_REASON\_RDTSCP - 51**\) vm-exits to implement **RDTSC/RDTSCP** hooks.

### **Remarks**

None

### Requirements

None
