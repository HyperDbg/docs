# sb, sd, sq \(search virtual memory\)

### Command

> sb : search virtual memory as Byte values
>
> sd : search virtual memory as Double-word values \(4 bytes\)
>
> sq : search virtual memory as Quad-word values \(8 bytes\)

### Syntax

> sb \[search from address \(hex\)\] l \[length \(hex\)\] \[byte pattern \(hex\)\] pid \[process id \(hex\)\]
>
> sd \[search from address \(hex\)\] l \[length \(hex\)\] \[byte pattern \(hex\)\] pid \[process id \(hex\)\]
>
> sq \[search from address \(hex\)\] l \[length \(hex\)\] \[byte pattern \(hex\)\] pid \[process id \(hex\)\]

### Description

Searches the **virtual** memory for a special byte\(s\).

### Parameters

\[search from address \(hex\)\]

          The **virtual** address of where we want to start searching from its address.

l \[length \(hex\)\]

          Length of the searching area.

\[byte pattern \(hex\)\]

          Search for these bytes \(pattern\)

pid \[process id \(hex\)\]  \(optional\)

          The process ID in the hex format that we want to see the memory from its context \(**cr3**\).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't specify the **pid**, then the default **pid** is the current process \(**HyperDbg**\) process layout of memory.
{% endhint %}

### Examples

The following command is used to search for `4156415748` starting from ``fffff807`7356f010`` to ``fffff807`7356f010+ffff``.

```diff
HyperDbg> sb fffff807`7356f010 l ffff 41 56 41 57 48 
```

The following example is used when we want to search for `f0cc8549` from `7FF62C9016AD` to `7FF62C9016AD+fff` in a different process \(process id = `1dd0`\) .

```diff
HyperDbg> sd 7FF62C9016AD pid 1dd0 l fff f0cc8549 
```

The following example is used when we want to search for ``0f450000`00c0888b`` ``8b410000`0092b1b7`` from ``fffff807`7356f010`` to ``fffff807`7356f010+100``.

```diff
HyperDbg> sq fffff807`7356f010 l 100 0f450000`00c0888b 8b410000`0092b1b7
```

### IOCTL

This function works by calling **DeviceIoControl** with `IOCTL = IOCTL_DEBUGGER_SEARCH_MEMORY`, you have to send it in the following structure.

```c
typedef struct _DEBUGGER_SEARCH_MEMORY {

  UINT64 Address;                            // Target adddress to start searching
  UINT64 Length;                             // Length of bytes to search
  UINT32 ProcessId;                          // specifies the process id
  DEBUGGER_SEARCH_MEMORY_TYPE MemoryType;    // Type of memory
  DEBUGGER_SEARCH_MEMORY_BYTE_SIZE ByteSize; // Modification size
  UINT32 CountOf64Chunks;
  UINT32 FinalStructureSize;

} DEBUGGER_SEARCH_MEMORY, *PDEBUGGER_SEARCH_MEMORY;
```

 The `Address` is where we want to start searching from its memory, and it can be both a **physical** address or a **virtual** address.

`ProcessId` is the process that we want to modify based on its memory layout \(**cr3**\), it can't be `null` or zero.

`MemoryType` shows whether the `Address` is a **physical** address or a **virtual** address.

You can see its values in the following enum :

```c
typedef enum _DEBUGGER_SEARCH_MEMORY_TYPE {
  SEARCH_PHYSICAL_MEMORY,
  SEARCH_VIRTUAL_MEMORY
} DEBUGGER_SEARCH_MEMORY_TYPE;
```

`ByteSize` shows whether we want to search the target Address in a **byte**, **dword**, or **qword** format. 

```c
typedef enum _DEBUGGER_SEARCH_MEMORY_BYTE_SIZE {
  SEARCH_BYTE,
  SEARCH_DWORD,
  SEARCH_QWORD
} DEBUGGER_SEARCH_MEMORY_BYTE_SIZE;
```

The above structure is added on top of an array of 64-bit values, which is the new content to the memory. 

For example, if you want to search in the memory address of  the target for`0x90 0x90` then you should provide an array of `0x0000000000000090` and `0x0000000000000090` and append it to the end of the above structure. The count of these chunks is stored at `CountOf64Chunks` in the above structure and the final buffer that will be sent into the kernel has a size of `FinalStructureSize` bytes. 

Also, you should provide a buffer \(size = `MaximumSearchResults * sizeof(UINT64)`\) as the output buffer, so the kernel-mode module will fill this buffer with a 64-bit array or addresses that match our search results.

You can read the result buffer as an `UINT64` array, and if you encounter a null entry, then it means there is no other result.

### **Remarks**

* You can search for as many bytes as you need in **byte**, **dword**, and **qword** formats; just add the multiple byte\(s\) values to the end of the command.
