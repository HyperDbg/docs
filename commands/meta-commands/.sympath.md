# .sympath (set the symbol server)

### Command

> .sympath

### Syntax

> .sympath
>
> .sympath \[SymServer (string)]

### Description

Sets the symbol path and symbol server.

### Parameters

**\[SymServer (string)]**

The symbol path and symbol server.

### Examples

The following command sets the symbol path to `SRV*c:\symbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols`.

```
HyperDbg> .sympath SRV*c:\Symbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
```

The following command shows the current symbol server.

```
HyperDbg> .sympath
current SymbolServer is : SRV*c:\Symbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
```

### IOCTL

None

### Remarks

You should separate the symbol path and servers by `*` delimiter. For instance, take a look at the following path:

`SRV*c:\symbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols`

In the above path, first, it checks if the symbol exists in `c:\symbols`. If not, then it checks `https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols`.

All the paths strings should be started with `SRV*`.

### Requirements

None
