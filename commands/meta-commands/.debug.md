# .debug \(prepare and connect to debugger\)

### Command

> .debug

### Syntax

> .debug \[action \(remote \| prepare\)\] \[type \(serial \| namedpipe\)\] \[baud rate \(decimal value\)\] address

### Description

This command prepares debuggee for a remote connection or connects to a remote debuggee.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that first, you should wait for reconnecting on the **debugger,** then connect to it in the **debuggee.**
{% endhint %}

### Parameters

\[action \(remote \| prepare\)\]

          If you specify `remote` then it means that you want to connect to a debuggee or if you specify `prepare` then it means that you want to prepare the current machine to be debugged as debuggee.

\[type \(serial \| namedpipe\)\]

          If you want to use a serial port as the connection, you should choose `serial` ****and if you want to connect to a named pipe then you should specify `namedpipe`. Please note that `namedpipe` cannot be used in debuggee and it can be used only in the debugger.

\[baud rate \(decimal value\)\]

          This value shows the baud rate of the device. \(See [Remarks](https://docs.hyperdbg.com/commands/meta-commands/.debug#remarks) for more information\)

address

          COM port address or named pipe address. \(See [Remarks](https://docs.hyperdbg.com/commands/meta-commands/.debug#remarks) for more information\)

### Examples

If you want to have a kernel debug connection, first you should run the following command in a debugger \(host\). As you can see, you can change the `com3`to your COM port that is connected to the debuggee. 

```text
.debug remote serial 115200 com3
```

If you want to use a named pipe instead of a COM port, you can execute the following command in the debugger \(Host\).

```text
.debug remote namedpipe \\\\.\\pipe\\HyperDbgPipe
```

After you tell the debugger to listen on a COM port or a named pipe, now you can run the following command in the debuggee.

```text
.debug prepare serial 115200 com2
```

### IOCTL

See [here](https://docs.hyperdbg.com/design/debugger-internals/kernel-debugger/connection) to see the design of the kernel debugger connectin.

### **Remarks**
