{% hint style="success" %}
In HyperDbg's batch scripts '`#`' is used as the [comment character](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/commands/debugging-commands/comment). However, in the script engine, it uses a C-like [commenting style](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/commands/scripting-language/assumptions-and-evaluations#comments).
