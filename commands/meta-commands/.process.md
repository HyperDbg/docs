# .process \(show the current process and switch to another process\)

## Command

> .process

## Syntax

> .process \[type \(pid\)\] \[process id \(hex value\)\]

## Description

Shows or changes the current process. This command can only be used in **Debugger Mode**. Please take a look at the [**Remarks**](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/commands/meta-commands/.process#remarks) for more information.

If you want to change the process to a new process, after using the '**.process**' command, you should use the '[g](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/commands/debugging-commands/g)' command.

## Parameters

**\[type \(pid\)\] \(optional\)**

```text
      Currently, the only available option is **pid**, which shows that you want to specify a process id at the second parameter.
```

**\[process id \(hex value\)\] \(optional\)**

```text
      The process id of the process to switch on its memory layout.
```

{% hint style="success" %}
If you don't specify any parameters to the '**.process**' command, it shows the current process.
{% endhint %}

## Examples

The following command shows the current process.

```diff
0: kHyperDbg> .process
current process id : 1ddc
```

The following commands change the current process to `0x1ddc`.

```text
0: kHyperDbg> .process pid 1ddc
press 'g' to continue the debuggee, if the pid is valid then the debuggee will be automatically paused when it attached to the target process

0: kHyperDbg> g
Debuggee is running...
fffff801`68d91262    0F 01 C1                            vmcall
```

## IOCTL

This commands works over serial by sending the serial packets to the remote computer.

First of all, you should fill the following structure, set the `ProcessId` to your target process \(if you want to change the current process\) and set `GetRemotePid` to **false**, and leave the `Result`.

If you want to get the current process id, then set the `GetRemotePid` to **true** and leave the `ProcessId`.

```c
typedef struct _DEBUGGEE_CHANGE_PROCESS_PACKET {

  BOOLEAN GetRemotePid;
  UINT32 ProcessId;
  UINT32 Result;

} DEBUGGEE_CHANGE_PROCESS_PACKET, *PDEBUGGEE_CHANGE_PROCESS_PACKET;
```

After that, send the above structure to the debuggee when debuggee is paused and waiting for new command on **vmx-root** mode.

You should send the above structure with `DEBUGGER_REMOTE_PACKET_REQUESTED_ACTION_ON_VMX_ROOT_MODE_CHANGE_PROCESS` as `RequestedAction` and `DEBUGGER_REMOTE_PACKET_TYPE_DEBUGGER_TO_DEBUGGEE_EXECUTE_ON_VMX_ROOT` as `PacketType`.

In return, the debuggee sends the above structure with the following type.

```c
DEBUGGER_REMOTE_PACKET_REQUESTED_ACTION_DEBUGGEE_RESULT_OF_CHANGING_PROCESS
```

In the returned structure, the `Result` is filled by the kernel.

If the `Result` is `DEBUGEER_OPERATION_WAS_SUCCESSFULL`, then the operation was successful, and you should use the '[g](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/commands/debugging-commands/g)' command to move to the new process. Otherwise, the returned result is an error, and the current process is not changed. If you want the current process, then if the `Result` is `DEBUGEER_OPERATION_WAS_SUCCESSFULL`, then the current process id is stored at `ProcessId`.

The following function is responsible for changing the core in the debugger.

```c
BOOLEAN KdSendSwitchProcessPacketToDebuggee(BOOLEAN GetRemotePid, UINT32 NewPid);
```

## **Remarks**

By default, HyperDbg is spinning on vmx-root, and the default process is the system process `pid = 4`. Thus, the **cr3** is the system process's **cr3**. When you change the process using the '**.process**' command, HyperDbg is spinning on vmx-root with the target process's **kernel cr3** \(not the system's **cr3**\).

This command won't switch to the new process. It changes the **cr3** \(memory layout\).

The current implementation of the '**.process**' command for changing the process \(not getting the current process\) is unsafe and might cause the system to halt in rare cases.
