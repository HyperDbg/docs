# .switch (show the list and switch between active debugging processes)

### Command

> .switch

### Syntax

> .switch \[list | pid | tid] \[process id | thread id (hex)]

### Description

Shows a list of active debugging processes and threads or switches between different active debugging threads and processes. This command displays the list of intercepted threads that you can switch to these processes or threads. It won't show all of the threads of the target process.

{% hint style="info" %}
This command won't use any Windows API for intercepting and pausing threads, and everything is done at the hypervisor level.
{% endhint %}

### Parameters

**\[list | pid | tid]**

The target process id

**\[process id | thread id (hex)]**

The thread id or the process id to set as active debugging thread/process.

### Examples

The following command shows the list of active debugging threads/processes.

```
1b08:2050 u64HyperDbg> .switch list
1a78 (process)
           2020 (thread)
*1b08 (process)
           1380 (thread)
           1ed4 (thread)
        -> 2050 (thread)
```

We'll use the following command to switch to thread id `0x2020`.

```
1b08:2050 u64HyperDbg> .switch tid 2020
switched to thread id: 2020
```

As you can see, the arrow in the list of active debugging threads is changed.

```
1a78:2020 u86HyperDbg> .switch list
*1a78 (process)
        -> 2020 (thread)
1b08 (process)
           1380 (thread)
           1ed4 (thread)
           2050 (thread)
```

It is also possible to switch by using process id.

```
1a78:428 u86HyperDbg> .switch pid 1b08
switched to process id: 1b08
```

Again, the active debugging process (thread) is changed.

```
1b08:1380 u64HyperDbg> .switch list
1a78 (process)
           2020 (thread)
           0428 (thread)
           0940 (thread)
           13e4 (thread)
*1b08 (process)
        -> 1380 (thread)
           1ed4 (thread)
           2050 (thread)
```

### IOCTL

None

### Remarks

This command is logically designed to be used in [**VMI Mode**](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/using-hyperdbg/prerequisites/operation-modes#vmi-mode). You can use the '[.process](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/commands/meta-commands/.process)' and the '[.thread](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/commands/meta-commands/.thread)' commands in [**Debugger Mode**](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/using-hyperdbg/prerequisites/operation-modes#debugger-mode).
