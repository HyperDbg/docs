# .switch (show the list and switch between active debugging processes)

### Command

> .switch

### Syntax

> .switch
>
> .switch \[pid ProcessId (hex)]
>
> .switch \[tid ThreadId (hex)]

### Description

Shows a list of active debugging processes and threads or switches between different active debugging threads and processes. This command displays the list of intercepted threads that you can switch to these processes or threads. It **won't** show all of the threads of the target process.

{% hint style="success" %}
If you don't specify any parameters to this command, it shows the list of threads and processes.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
This command won't use any Windows API for intercepting and pausing threads, and everything is done at the hypervisor level.
{% endhint %}

### Parameters

**\[pid ProcessId (hex)]**

The target Process Id to switch.

**\[tid ThreadId (hex)]**

The target Thread Id to switch.

### Examples

The following command shows the list of active debugging threads/processes.

```
1b08:2050 u64HyperDbg> .switch
1a78 (process)
           2020 (thread) | # blkd exec attempts: 19a784
*1b08 (process)
           1380 (thread) | # blkd exec attempts: 207cac
           1ed4 (thread) | # blkd exec attempts: 2012c1
        -> 2050 (thread) | # blkd exec attempts: 1d788d
```

We'll use the following command to switch to thread id `0x2020`.

```
1b08:2050 u64HyperDbg> .switch tid 2020
switched to thread id: 2020
```

As you can see, the arrow in the list of active debugging threads is changed.

```
1a78:2020 u86HyperDbg> .switch
*1a78 (process)
        -> 2020 (thread) | # blkd exec attempts: 147b38
1b08 (process)
           1380 (thread) | # blkd exec attempts: 13a8e6
           1ed4 (thread) | # blkd exec attempts: 29d783
           2050 (thread) | # blkd exec attempts: 1ab7d6
```

It is also possible to switch by using process id.

```
1a78:428 u86HyperDbg> .switch pid 1b08
switched to process id: 1b08
```

Again, the active debugging process (thread) is changed.

```
1b08:1380 u64HyperDbg> .switch
1a78 (process)
           2020 (thread) | # blkd exec attempts: 11a224
           0428 (thread) | # blkd exec attempts: 19a51a
           0940 (thread) | # blkd exec attempts: 1136fa
           13e4 (thread) | # blkd exec attempts: 1d0144
*1b08 (process)
        -> 1380 (thread) | # blkd exec attempts: 5789a1
           1ed4 (thread) | # blkd exec attempts: 4582b4
           2050 (thread) | # blkd exec attempts: 5f61ab
```

### IOCTL

This function works by calling **DeviceIoControl** with `IOCTL = IOCTL_DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS`. You have to send it in the following structure.

```c
typedef struct _DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS
{
    BOOLEAN                                              IsStartingNewProcess;
    UINT32                                               ProcessId;
    UINT32                                               ThreadId;
    BOOLEAN                                              Is32Bit;
    BOOLEAN                                              IsPaused; // used in switching to threads
    DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS_ACTION_TYPE Action;
    UINT32                                               CountOfActiveDebuggingThreadsAndProcesses; // used in showing the list of active threads/processes
    UINT64                                               Token;
    UINT64                                               Result;

} DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS, *PDEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS;
```

First, you should set the **Action** to `DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS_ACTION_QUERY_COUNT_OF_ACTIVE_DEBUGGING_THREADS` in the above structure, when the IOCTL returns from the kernel, **CountOfActiveDebuggingThreadsAndProcesses** is filled with appropriate data from the process.

After getting the results from the kernel and if the **Result** is equal to `DEBUGGER_OPERATION_WAS_SUCCESSFULL` you should pass a new **IOCTL** to the kernel again.

The new IOCTL is equal to `IOCTL_GET_DETAIL_OF_ACTIVE_THREADS_AND_PROCESSES`. There is no need for the input buffer, but for the output buffer, you should allocate a memory with the size of the following structure multiplied by the count of threads/processes returned from the previous IOCTL.

```
typedef struct _USERMODE_DEBUGGING_THREAD_OR_PROCESS_STATE_DETAILS
{
    UINT32  ProcessId;
    UINT32  ThreadId;
    BOOLEAN IsProcess;

} USERMODE_DEBUGGING_THREAD_OR_PROCESS_STATE_DETAILS, *PUSERMODE_DEBUGGING_THREAD_OR_PROCESS_STATE_DETAILS;
```

The **Action** can be from the following enum:

```
typedef enum _DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS_ACTION_TYPE
{
    DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS_ACTION_ATTACH,
    DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS_ACTION_DETACH,
    DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS_ACTION_REMOVE_HOOKS,
    DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS_ACTION_KILL_PROCESS,
    DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS_ACTION_PAUSE_PROCESS,
    DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS_ACTION_SWITCH_BY_PROCESS_OR_THREAD,
    DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS_ACTION_QUERY_COUNT_OF_ACTIVE_DEBUGGING_THREADS,

} DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS_ACTION_TYPE;
```

### Remarks

The `blkd exec attempts` shows the number of times the operating system (e.g., Windows kernel) attempted to execute user-mode code in this thread (context is switched to this thread), and HyperDbg's user debugger blocked the execution of the user-mode code at the hypervisor level.

This command is logically designed to be used in [**VMI Mode**](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/using-hyperdbg/prerequisites/operation-modes#vmi-mode). You can use the '[.process](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/commands/meta-commands/.process)' and the '[.thread](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/commands/meta-commands/.thread)' commands in [**Debugger Mode**](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/using-hyperdbg/prerequisites/operation-modes#debugger-mode).

### Requirements
