### IOCTL

This commands works over serial by sending the serial packets to the remote computer.

First of all, you should fill the following structure, set the `ScriptBufferSize` and `ScriptBufferPointer` to the values you got from the script engine interpreter, and leave the `Result` and set the `IsFormat` to **true**.

After that, you should move the interpreted buffer to the end of the structure (this structure is a header for the interpreted buffer).

```c
typedef struct _DEBUGGEE_SCRIPT_PACKET {

  UINT32 ScriptBufferSize;
  UINT32 ScriptBufferPointer;
  BOOLEAN IsFormat;
  UINT32 Result;

  //
  // The script buffer is here
  //

} DEBUGGEE_SCRIPT_PACKET, *PDEBUGGEE_SCRIPT_PACKET;
```

The next step is sending the above structure to the debuggee when debuggee is paused and waiting for new command on **vmx-root** mode.

You should send the above structure with `DEBUGGER_REMOTE_PACKET_REQUESTED_ACTION_ON_VMX_ROOT_RUN_SCRIPT` as `RequestedAction` and `DEBUGGER_REMOTE_PACKET_TYPE_DEBUGGER_TO_DEBUGGEE_EXECUTE_ON_VMX_ROOT` as `PacketType`.

In return, the debuggee sends two packets back to the debugger. The first packet type is:

```c
DEBUGGER_REMOTE_PACKET_REQUESTED_ACTION_DEBUGGEE_RESULT_OF_FORMATS
```

This packet should be interpreted based on the following structure:

```c
typedef struct _DEBUGGEE_FORMATS_PACKET {

  UINT64 Value;
  UINT32 Result;

} DEBUGGEE_FORMATS_PACKET, *PDEBUGGEE_FORMATS_PACKET;
```

The value should be passed to the following function to illustrate different formats.

```c
VOID CommandFormatsShowResults(UINT64 U64Value);
```

If the `Result` is `DEBUGEER_OPERATION_WAS_SUCCESSFULL`, then the operation was successful. Otherwise, the returned result is an error.

After that, the debuggee sends the above structure with the following type.

```c
DEBUGGER_REMOTE_PACKET_REQUESTED_ACTION_DEBUGGEE_RESULT_OF_RUNNING_SCRIPT
```

In the returned structure, the `Result` is filled by the kernel.

If the `Result` is `DEBUGEER_OPERATION_WAS_SUCCESSFULL`, then the operation was successful. Otherwise, the returned result is an error.

The following function is responsible for sending script buffers in the debugger.

```c
BOOLEAN KdSendScriptPacketToDebuggee(UINT64 BufferAddress, UINT32 BufferLength, UINT32 Pointer, BOOLEAN IsFormat);
```

### Remarks

This command is guaranteed to keep debuggee in a halt state (in Debugger Mode); thus, nothing will change during its execution.

### Requirements
