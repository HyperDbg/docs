# .kill (terminate the process)

### Command

> .kill

### Syntax

> .kill&#x20;

### Description

Terminates the currently active process (that was previously started by using the '[.start](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/commands/meta-commands/.start)', or the '[.attach](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/commands/meta-commands/.attach)' commands).

### Parameters

None

### Examples

Imagine we want to terminate a program that we previously started by using the '[.start](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/commands/meta-commands/.start)' command.

```
0: kHyperDbg> .kill
```

### IOCTL

The IOCTL description is the same as the '[.start](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/commands/meta-commands/.start)' command, but instead of **Action**, you should send `DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS_ACTION_KILL_PROCESS`.

### Remarks

This command will continue the debuggee for some time (in Debugger Mode). This means that you lose the current context (registers & memory) after executing this command.

### Requirements

None
