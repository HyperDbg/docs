# .start (start a new process)

### Command

> .start

### Syntax

> .start \[path (path string)] \[parameters to process (string)]

### Description

Starts a program with the specific parameters and breaks when the PE file reaches the entrypoint.

{% hint style="danger" %}
In contrast with the kernel debugger, the user debugger is still very basic and needs a lot of tests and improvements. We **highly recommend** not to run the user debugger in your bare metal system. Instead, run it on a [supported virtual machine](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/tips-and-tricks/nested-virtualization-environments/supported-virtual-machines) to won't end up with a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) in your primary device. Please keep reporting the issues to improve the user debugger.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
This command won't use any Windows API for intercepting and pausing threads, and everything is done at the hypervisor level.
{% endhint %}

### Parameters

**\[path (path string)]**

The target file path

**\[parameters to process (string)]**

The parameter(s) to the file

### Examples

Imagine we want to start a program without parameters.

```
0: kHyperDbg> .start path C:\file\my_file.exe
```

If your file path contains a space character, you should write the path between two quotes; otherwise, it will be interpreted as parameters.

```
0: kHyperDbg> .start path "C:\my files\my file.exe"
```

If you want to pass parameters to your target file. Imagine we want to pass `-m 1 -o out.txt` parameters to our exe file.

```
0: kHyperDbg> .start path "C:\my files\my file.exe" -m 1 -o out.txt
```

### IOCTL

This function works by calling **DeviceIoControl** with `IOCTL = IOCTL_DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS`. You have to send it in the following structure.

```c
typedef struct _DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS
{
    BOOLEAN                                              IsStartingNewProcess;
    UINT32                                               ProcessId;
    UINT32                                               ThreadId;
    BOOLEAN                                              Is32Bit;
    BOOLEAN                                              IsPaused; // used in switching to threads
    DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS_ACTION_TYPE Action;
    UINT32                                               CountOfActiveDebuggingThreadsAndProcesses; // used in showing the list of active threads/processes
    UINT64                                               Token;
    UINT64                                               Result;

} DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS, *PDEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS;
```

First, you should create a process in the suspended state, then you should fill the **ProcessId** and **ThreadId**, set the **IsStartingNewProcess** to `TRUE` and **Action** to `DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS_ACTION_ATTACH` in the above structure, when the IOCTL returns from the kernel, other parts are filled with appropriate data from the process.

After getting the results from the kernel and if the **Result** is equal to `DEBUGGER_OPERATION_WAS_SUCCESSFULL` you should pass this **IOCTL** to the kernel again, but this time, change the **Action** to `DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS_ACTION_REMOVE_HOOKS`.

The **Action** can be from the following enum:

```
typedef enum _DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS_ACTION_TYPE
{
    DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS_ACTION_ATTACH,
    DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS_ACTION_DETACH,
    DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS_ACTION_REMOVE_HOOKS,
    DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS_ACTION_KILL_PROCESS,
    DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS_ACTION_PAUSE_PROCESS,
    DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS_ACTION_SWITCH_BY_PROCESS_OR_THREAD,
    DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS_ACTION_QUERY_COUNT_OF_ACTIVE_DEBUGGING_THREADS,

} DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS_ACTION_TYPE;
```

### Remarks

This command will continue the debuggee for some time (in Debugger Mode). This means that you lose the current context (registers & memory) after executing this command.

### Requirements

None
