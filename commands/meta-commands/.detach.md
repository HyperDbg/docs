description: Description of '.detach' command in HyperDbg.

# .detach (detach from the process)

### Command

> .detach

### Syntax

> .detach

### Description

Detaches from the currently active process.

### Parameters

None

### Examples

Imagine we want to detach from the currently active process (a previously started program using the '[.start](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/commands/meta-commands/.start)' command or a process attached by using the '.[attach](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/commands/meta-commands/.attach)' command).

```
1b08:1290 u64HyperDbg> .detach
```

### IOCTL

The IOCTL description is the same as the '[.start](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/commands/meta-commands/.start)' command, but instead of **Action**, you should send `DEBUGGER_ATTACH_DETACH_USER_MODE_PROCESS_ACTION_DETACH`, only set the **ProcessId** to the target Process ID.

### Remarks

If you want to detach from a process, the process must not be in a paused state. Thus, you should remove all the break events or continue the process before detaching from them. HyperDbg will automatically continue the target process before detaching.

This command is logically designed to be used in [**VMI Mode**](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/using-hyperdbg/prerequisites/operation-modes#vmi-mode). You can use the '[.process](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/commands/meta-commands/.process)' and the '[.thread](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/commands/meta-commands/.thread)' commands in [**Debugger Mode**](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/using-hyperdbg/prerequisites/operation-modes#debugger-mode).

### Requirements
